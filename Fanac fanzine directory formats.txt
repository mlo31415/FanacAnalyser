# This file exists to document the various flavors of fanzine directory formats on fanac.org
# The lines beginning with '#' are comments to be ignored
# The noncmment part of the file consists of lines beginning with a pair of numbers which indicates the format.
# The numbers are followed by a comma-delimited list of names of directories which are in that format.  
# There may be more than one line starting with a given numeral.
# The first number of the pair says where the link can be found
# The second number of the pair says something about how individual issues are designated

# The first number:
# 1 -- Directory includes a table with the first column containing links
# 2 -- The directory is the ToC page for a single issue or just the issue's text
# 3 -- There are as yet no scans it's just a text listing of issues
# 4 -- The first column has an issue designation, but it's sort of random and/or complicated
# 5 -- Kinda random 
# 6 -- The link goes directly to a pdf
# 7 -- Dead link
# 8 -- The link goes directly to an HTML page other than index.html
# 9 -- The link goes to a different website


# The second number:
# 0 -- Undefined
# 1 -- The issue number is at the end of the link text and there is a Year column
# 2 -- There is no link column item number. Typically this is because there is only a single issue
# 3 -- There is no link column item number, but this is sloppiness since it's a single numbered issue (e.g., Abstract #9)
# 4 -- Only a date is supplied, and that's in separate table columns
# 5 -- An issue number is supplied in a separate column
# 6 -- Issues are designated in the link column as V<n>, #<n>
# 8 -- Issue numbers are Roman numerals
# 9 -- Issue numbers and dates are in separate columns
# 10 -- Month, Day, and Year columns exist, but no issue number columns
# 11 -- Kinda random/Mixed
# 12 -- Issue number is added to Fanzine name with a hyphen, #, or other leading character

# 1, 1 describes most directories and is the default, and those directories are not noted below
